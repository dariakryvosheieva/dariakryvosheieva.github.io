		<center><h3> Welcome! • Вітаю! • Wilkommen! • Добро пожаловать! • Üdvözlöm!</h3></center>
		<p>I'm Daria, a first-year MIT student from Ukraine intending to major in Artificial Intelligence and minor in Linguistics. I am excited by computer science, machine learning, linguistics, and languages, being especially enthusiastic about natural language processing as a field where computer science and linguistics meet.</p>
		<p>In high school, I represented Ukraine at the <a href="https://ioling.org">International Linguistics Olympiad</a>. The olympiad experience taught me to think outside of the box of my native language and culture and to look for non-trivial, creative problem solutions. I still support the linguistics olympiad community by authoring and testing competition problems.</p>
		<p>My study of foreign languages has been a mixture of dedicated preparation for proficiency exams and free exploration. As a consequence of the former, I'm fluent in English and German. As a consequence of the latter, I know several more languages at an elementary level (e.g. Hungarian, Mandarin Chinese, or even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shona_language">chiShona</a>).</p>
		<p>Currently, I'm actively looking for opportunities to gain practical experience in ML.</p>
		<p>And yes, I can write backwards with my left hand!</p>
		<p>A CV is available <a href="cv.pdf">here</a>.</p>
